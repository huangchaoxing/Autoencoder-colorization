# Autoencoder-colorization
## Overview
This is a toy practice of deep learning based image auto-colorization. The result is pretty naive and not perfect but at least give some intuiation and
help understand the pipeline.  
## Dependency and dataset
Pytorch 0.4.1  
skimage  
TensorbrardX for visualization  
The dataset is the test set of the [MIT 205](http://places.csail.mit.edu/downloadData.html)
